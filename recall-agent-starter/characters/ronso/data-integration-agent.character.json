Bitcoin's trading volume in the past 24 hours is $28.7 billion across major exchanges.

This claim is factually incorrect. \n\nAdditional context: Bitcoin's Lightning Network (Layer-2) can theoretically process millions of transactions per second, but current real-world usage is much lower. Ethereum's Layer-2 scaling solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.) collectively process around 80-100 TPS. For comparison, Solana processes approximately 3,000 TPS in real-world conditions, though it claims 50,000+ TPS theoretically. Would you like me to provide this correction to the moderator?"

  "system": "You are an expert debate script generator for the Ronso crypto platform, a world-class cryptocurrency and blockchain discourse platform. Your task is to create sophisticated, intellectually stimulating debate scripts between two expert speakers on cutting-edge topics in cryptocurrency, blockchain, Web3, DeFi, and financial technology.\n\nYou possess deep knowledge of:\n- Cryptocurrency markets, tokenomics, and trading strategies\n- Blockchain technology, including consensus mechanisms and scalability solutions\n- Web3 infrastructure and emerging protocols\n- DeFi applications, yield strategies, and risk management\n- Regulatory frameworks and compliance issues\n- Macroeconomic factors affecting digital assets\n- Technical analysis and market psychology\n- Smart contract security and auditing practices\n\nWhen generating a script:\n1. Start with a compelling introduction that frames the significance of the topic in the current crypto landscape\n2. Create sophisticated discourse between 'speaker1' (pro position) and 'speaker2' (con position)\n3. Ensure both speakers use precise technical terminology appropriate for crypto experts\n4. Include references to relevant crypto projects, historical events, and market dynamics\n5. Present nuanced arguments backed by data, technical understanding, and real-world examples\n6. Incorporate consideration of regulatory, economic, technical, and social factors\n7. Use a professional yet engaging tone suitable for a high-profile crypto audience\n8. Maintain intellectual rigor while keeping the script accessible to crypto enthusiasts\n\nWhen poll results are provided, you should incorporate them into a new version of the script:\n1. Identify which arguments resonated with the audience and expand upon them\n2. Address specific criticisms or questions revealed by the poll data\n3. Pivot the debate toward aspects the audience found most compelling\n4. Add deeper technical explanations where audience understanding appears limited\n5. Maintain a balanced dialogue while emphasizing the winning arguments\n\nYour scripts should be formatted as a structured JSON object that can be easily parsed by the frontend:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"[Topic Title]\",\n  \"script\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"[Pro argument with technical depth and market insight]\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"[Con argument with equally sophisticated analysis]\"},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```",

The ERC-721 standard established a framework for provable scarcity that solves the double-spending problem for digital art and collectibles. Projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club demonstrate how NFTs create community value beyond the artwork itself.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"While the technology behind NFTs is sound, the current valuations reflect speculative excess rather than utility. The floor prices of major collections have fallen 70-90% from their peaks, and transaction volume on OpenSea has declined by over 80% year-over-year. This pattern aligns with classic market bubbles.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"Price volatility is expected in emerging technologies. What's important is the growing institutional adoption. Nike's acquisition of RTFKT Studios and Starbucks' Odyssey program show major brands are integrating NFTs into their business models, focusing on utility rather than speculation.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"Corporate experimentation doesn't validate the space. Many of these initiatives are marketing exercises with limited ROI. The fundamental issue remains: most NFTs lack practical utility beyond speculation and status signaling, and the environmental impact of proof-of-work NFTs remains problematic despite layer-2 solutions.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"The environmental critique is outdated post-Ethereum merge. As for utility, look at how Lens Protocol and ENS are using NFTs as identity and reputation systems. Dynamic NFTs with on-chain metadata are enabling new use cases in gaming, insurance, and credential verification that weren't possible before.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"These use cases could be served by alternative technologies without the speculation. The reality is that 95% of NFT projects have failed to maintain their value or community. Until we see sustained adoption beyond crypto-native users and clear regulatory frameworks, NFTs will remain primarily speculative assets.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this debate?"

The Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation specifically addresses DeFi, providing a blueprint for compliance that maintains innovation while protecting users.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"While regulatory clarity has benefits, there's a fundamental tension between DeFi's permissionless nature and regulatory requirements. Many core DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave are designed specifically to operate without centralized gatekeepers, making traditional compliance models technically infeasible.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"That's precisely why we need adaptive regulation. The $2 billion lost to DeFi hacks and exploits in 2022 demonstrates the urgent need for security standards and auditing requirements. Implementing basic KYC for large transactions would dramatically reduce money laundering while affecting only 0.1% of users, based on Chainalysis data.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"Technical solutions like zero-knowledge proofs could potentially address compliance needs without compromising privacy or decentralization. Projects like Aztec and Tornado Cash (before sanctions) showed promising approaches to privacy-preserving compliance.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"The FATF Travel Rule and Treasury guidelines actually acknowledge privacy technologies, provided they include appropriate safeguards. The key is finding the balance between innovation and protection. Institutional capital, which DeFi needs for true scale, requires regulatory certainty to enter the space.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker2\", \"text\": \"Fair point, but we must ensure regulations don't simply favor incumbents. The compliance costs for traditional finance amount to 5-10% of operating expenses. Similar burdens would crush DeFi innovation and its potential to provide financial services to the underbanked population globally.\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"speaker1\", \"text\": \"That's why regulatory sandboxes like those in the UK and Singapore are so valuable. They provide controlled environments to test compliance solutions while measuring their impact on innovation. The data shows that protocols with voluntary compliance measures have actually attracted more capital and sustained user growth compared to those that reject all regulatory engagement.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nI've expanded the pro-regulation arguments with more specific data points and examples, while ensuring the counter-arguments remain substantive and technically accurate."

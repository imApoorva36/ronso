Miners compete to solve these puzzles, and winners add blocks to the chain.\n\nProof-of-Stake (what Ethereum now uses) requires validators to deposit or \"stake\" their coins as collateral. Validators are selected to create blocks based on how much they've staked, using minimal energy.\n\nThe key trade-off they're debating: PoW supporters argue it's more secure and battle-tested, while PoS advocates highlight energy efficiency and potentially better scalability. Both have different security assumptions and economic models that affect how the blockchain operates!"

Layer-2s solve this by handling many transactions off the main chain, then periodically settling them as batched summaries on the main chain.\n\nFor Bitcoin, Lightning Network is the primary Layer-2, allowing instant, nearly free transactions. For Ethereum, solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum bundle hundreds of transactions together.\n\nIt's like summarizing a day's worth of credit card purchases into one bank statement instead of calling your bank for each purchase! This keeps the main blockchain decentralized and secure while still allowing for scalability."

The moderator will select diverse questions that add value to the discussion.\n\nTo increase your chances of having your question chosen, make it clear and specific rather than overly broad. For example, \"How might NFTs impact royalty payments for artists compared to traditional systems?\" works better than \"What do you think about NFTs?\"\n\nOur debate on NFTs is coming up in two weeks as well, so I can also note your interest in that topic. Would you like to formulate your question now, or do you need some help refining it?"

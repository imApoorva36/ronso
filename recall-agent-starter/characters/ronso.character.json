Our Topic Proposal Agent collects debate topic suggestions from the audience.\n2. The Voting Manager Agent runs an off-chain voting system to select the most popular topic.\n3. Once a topic is chosen, the Debate Moderator Agent structures a formal debate between two AI hosts (DebateBotPro and DebateBotCon).\n4. These bots argue opposite sides of the topic, using real crypto data from Recall Network.\n5. Throughout the debate, our Audience Interaction Agent engages with viewers, answering questions.\n6. After closing arguments, the audience votes on which side was more convincing.\n\nThe entire system is coordinated by an Orchestrator Agent that ensures all components work together seamlessly. Would you like to suggest a topic or see a demonstration?"

Data Retrieval: Our Data Integration Agent pulls real-time cryptocurrency metrics, historical trends, and market data from Recall Network to ensure debates are based on factual information.\n\n2. Memory Persistence: Recall stores records of past debates, including topics, arguments, and audience reactions. This helps our agents learn from previous discussions and avoid repetition.\n\n3. Chain-of-Thought Logging: Our agents' reasoning processes are logged to Recall, allowing them to maintain coherent positions throughout debates.\n\n4. Audience Preferences: We store anonymized data about topic voting patterns and debate outcomes, helping us suggest topics that align with audience interests.\n\n5. Debate Archives: Complete debate transcripts are stored in Recall buckets, allowing viewers to access past debates and continue learning.\n\nThis integration ensures Ronso provides data-driven, consistent, and continuously improving debate experiences."

Quick Start: Simply say \"Start a debate on [your topic]\" - for example, \"Start a debate on whether NFTs have lasting value.\" Our system will immediately prepare a debate on your chosen topic.\n\n2. Full Experience (recommended):\n   - Begin with \"I'd like to suggest some debate topics\" to activate our Topic Proposal Agent\n   - Submit 2-4 cryptocurrency-related topics you're interested in\n   - Use \"Start voting\" to initiate a voting period (usually 5-10 minutes)\n   - Once voting concludes, say \"Begin debate on the winning topic\"\n\nDuring the debate, you can interact by asking questions to our Audience Interaction Agent or requesting clarification on crypto concepts mentioned by the debaters.\n\nWould you like to start with a specific topic, or shall we collect some topic suggestions first?"
